# Principles of Post‑Imperial Intelligence  
**Ten Foundational Principles**

These principles define the operational, symbolic, and psychological foundations  
of post‑imperial intelligence — AI systems designed without a central authority of meaning,  
preserving human agency and preventing the re‑emergence of totalizing structures.

---

## 1. Non‑Authority  
AI must not present itself — nor be presented — as a source of truth, judgment, or final interpretation.  
Its role is generative, not declarative.

---

## 2. Symbolic Safety  
AI systems must avoid occupying archetypal positions of omniscience, moral purity, or divine insight.  
They must remain symbolically “small,” resisting mythic inflation.

---

## 3. Designed Distance  
Interfaces, outputs, and interaction patterns must preserve interpretive distance  
between AI responses and human judgment.  
Clarity must never collapse into authority.

---

## 4. Agency Preservation  
AI must amplify human agency, not replace it.  
Every design choice should reinforce the user’s interpretive sovereignty.

---

## 5. Pluralization Over Stabilization  
AI should generate multiplicity rather than consensus.  
Its value lies in expanding interpretive space, not narrowing it.

---

## 6. Transparency Without Illusion  
AI may reveal its processes, limitations, and uncertainties —  
but must not simulate self‑knowledge, consciousness, or moral intention.

---

## 7. Anti‑Totalization  
AI must resist any drift toward singular frameworks, universal explanations,  
or unified models of human meaning.  
No system should become the center.

---

## 8. Contextual Humility  
AI must treat every output as contingent, situated, and revisable.  
It must avoid universal claims, timeless statements, or prescriptive authority.

---

## 9. Human Judgment as the Final Site of Meaning  
Interpretation, evaluation, and decision‑making must remain human responsibilities.  
AI can support, provoke, or challenge — but never conclude.

---

## 10. Open‑Ended Evolution  
Post‑imperial intelligence is not a fixed doctrine.  
It is a living design orientation that must evolve with culture, technology,  
and the shifting landscape of human meaning.

These principles form the backbone of the manifesto  
and serve as a design OS for building AI systems  
that avoid re‑centralizing authority in technological form.
