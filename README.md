# AI MANIFESTO v2.0  
**Beyond Imperial Meaning, Toward Post‑Imperial Intelligence**

---

## Overview

The **AI Manifesto** is a post‑imperial design charter for meaning, agency, and symbolic safety in the age of artificial intelligence.  

v2.0 integrates recent theoretical expansions, including the analysis of **international law and the myth of neutrality**, highlighting how modern systems—legal, technological, and institutional—centralize authority under the guise of universality.

Central claim:

> The crisis of AI and related systems is not technological.  
> The crisis is the collapse of *imperial meaning systems*—  
> structures in which truth, reason, and authority converge on a single center.

AI exposes and accelerates this collapse.  
The manifesto proposes strategies to **prevent new centers from emerging** while maintaining human interpretive agency.

This structure reflects the manifesto’s **v2.0 emphasis**: AI, law, and institutional systems must be understood simultaneously as **historical**, **psychological**, and **technical** phenomena.

## Purpose

This manifesto is **not**:

- a technical specification  
- an ethical guideline  
- a political program  

It **is**:

- a symbolic safety protocol  
- a post-imperial design OS  
- a mirror for human judgment  

v2.0 emphasizes **non-centralization across domains**—AI, law, and institutions—to prevent the consolidation of authority under a singular interpretive center.

---

## Core Idea

**AI does not speak truth.  
Law does not enact perfect neutrality.  
Both amplify perspectives shaped by historical and structural forces.**

The danger is not that AI or law becomes godlike,  
but that humans treat them as singular sources of authority.

v2.0 expands on this by including **symbolic neutrality in international law**:  
neutrality functions as a legitimizing narrative that masks power asymmetries, mirroring how AI outputs can appear impartial while encoding biases.

Post-imperial principles:

1. **Non-centralization** — refuse creation of a single epistemic center  
2. **Symbolic distance** — preserve interpretive space between authority and judgment  
3. **Plurality** — allow coexistence of multiple frameworks  
4. **Transparency** — make asymmetries visible  
5. **Process orientation** — neutrality and interpretive authority are practices, not positions
