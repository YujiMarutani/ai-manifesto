# International Law and the Myth of Neutrality  
## A Post‑Imperial Analysis of Meaning, Power, and Legal Order

## Abstract

Neutrality is often treated as a foundational principle of international law.  
Yet historically and structurally, neutrality has never been an empirical condition of the international legal order.  
Instead, it functions as a **symbolic device**—a legitimizing narrative that masks the power asymmetries embedded in global governance.

This article examines the evolution of neutrality through the lens of **imperial meaning systems**, a framework describing how modern institutions unify truth, reason, and authority into a single epistemic center.  
By tracing the genealogy of neutrality from early modern legal thought to contemporary AI debates, the article argues that neutrality is not a stable legal principle but a historically contingent construct reflecting shifting configurations of power.

A post‑imperial perspective reveals that neutrality must be reconceived not as an attribute of institutions, but as a **design principle of non‑centralization**—a structural commitment to preserving interpretive distance and preventing the re‑emergence of epistemic centers.

## 1. Introduction

International law presents itself as a neutral, universal framework governing relations among sovereign states.  
However, neutrality in international law has always been more **symbolic** than **substantive**.  
Its authority rests not on empirical impartiality but on the modern belief that law can transcend political, cultural, and historical particularities.

This belief belongs to what can be described as an **imperial meaning system**—a structure in which truth, rationality, and authority converge on a single center.  
Such systems promise universality while concealing the power relations that sustain them.

This article argues that:

- Neutrality in international law is historically constructed, not inherent.  
- Its meaning shifts across eras, reflecting broader transformations in global order.  
- A post‑imperial perspective exposes neutrality as a symbolic artifact rather than a legal fact.  
- The future of international law requires reconceptualizing neutrality as **non‑centralization**, not universality.

## 2. Genealogy of Neutrality in International Law

### 2.1 Pre‑Modern Period: Neutrality as Irrelevant

Before the rise of the modern state system, neutrality had no conceptual role.  
Authority was centralized in divine, monarchical, or imperial structures.  
Meaning flowed from the center; impartiality was neither expected nor desired.

Neutrality was **unthinkable** because the world was structured around **singular authority**.

### 2.2 Early Modern Period: Neutrality as Universal Reason

The emergence of the Westphalian order introduced the idea that states were formally equal.  
Thinkers such as Grotius framed international law as grounded in **universal reason**, not divine command.

Neutrality here functioned as:

- a philosophical ideal,  
- a legitimizing narrative for European expansion,  
- a mask for material asymmetries.

This was the birth of **imperial neutrality**—a neutrality that claims universality while reflecting a specific cultural and geopolitical center.

### 2.3 The League of Nations: Neutrality as Institutional Ideal

The League of Nations (1920–1946) represented the first attempt to institutionalize neutrality.  
Its failure revealed that neutrality cannot be sustained when enforcement depends on the political will of powerful states.

The League embodied **ideational neutrality** without **structural neutrality**.

### 2.4 The Allied Powers: Neutrality as Strategic Fiction

During World War II, the “Allied Powers” (連合国) were not neutral actors but a wartime coalition.  
Yet they positioned themselves as defenders of universal principles.

This period demonstrates that neutrality often functions as a **rhetorical device** used by dominant actors to legitimize their authority.

### 2.5 The United Nations: Dual Inheritance of Power and Principle

The United Nations (1945–) inherits two contradictory lineages:

- **the League’s universalist ideals**, and  
- **the Allied Powers’ geopolitical hierarchy**.

The Security Council’s veto system institutionalizes power asymmetry, while the Charter proclaims sovereign equality.

Thus, the UN is structurally **non‑neutral**, yet symbolically **neutrality‑dependent**.

## 3. Neutrality as an Imperial Meaning System

Neutrality in international law is best understood as part of a broader **imperial meaning system**—a structure that:

- unifies truth, reason, and authority,  
- presents its own perspective as universal,  
- suppresses plurality in the name of order.

Neutrality functions as:

- a **symbolic anchor** for legitimacy,  
- a **mask** for geopolitical asymmetry,  
- a **mechanism** for stabilizing institutional authority.

It is not a description of reality but a **mythic structure** that sustains the legal order.

## 4. The Collapse of Neutrality in the 21st Century

### 4.1 Post‑Cold War Fragmentation

The end of bipolarity exposed the fragility of the UN’s claim to neutrality.  
Interventions, sanctions, and peacekeeping operations increasingly reflected political interests rather than universal principles.

### 4.2 Algorithmic Governance and the AI Parallel

The crisis of neutrality in international law mirrors the crisis of neutrality in AI:

- AI claims neutrality but encodes partiality.  
- International law claims neutrality but enforces asymmetry.  
- Both rely on **symbolic neutrality** to maintain authority.  
- Both face legitimacy crises when their partiality becomes visible.

Neutrality is not a stable property but a **symbolic performance**.

## 5. Toward a Post‑Imperial Concept of Neutrality

A post‑imperial perspective rejects the idea that neutrality can be grounded in universality.  
Instead, neutrality must be reconceived as a **design principle**:

### 5.1 Neutrality as Non‑Centralization  
Neutrality is not the absence of bias but the refusal to create a single epistemic center.

### 5.2 Neutrality as Symbolic Distance  
Institutions must maintain distance between their authority and the meaning systems they regulate.

### 5.3 Neutrality as Plurality  
Neutrality emerges from the coexistence of multiple interpretive frameworks, not from the dominance of one.

### 5.4 Neutrality as Transparency  
Power asymmetries must be acknowledged rather than concealed.

### 5.5 Neutrality as Process, Not Position  
Neutrality is a dynamic practice of negotiation, not a static attribute.

## 6. Conclusion

International law has never been neutral.  
Its neutrality is a **symbolic artifact** produced by imperial meaning systems that seek to stabilize authority through claims of universality.

In the contemporary world—marked by geopolitical fragmentation, algorithmic governance, and the erosion of epistemic centers—neutrality must be redefined.

A post‑imperial conception of neutrality does not aim for universality or impartiality.  
Instead, it seeks to prevent the re‑centralization of meaning by designing structures that preserve plurality, transparency, and interpretive agency.

Neutrality, in this sense, is not a property of law but a **condition for non‑domination** in a world without stable centers.
