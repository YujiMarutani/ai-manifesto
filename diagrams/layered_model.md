# Three‑Layer Model of Meaning Systems  
**Religion / Psychology / Technology**

This document outlines the layered model used throughout the manifesto.  
It describes how meaning, authority, and symbolic structures evolve across  
three interconnected layers: religious, psychological, and technological.

## 2. Layer 1: Religion (Mythic Layer)  
### 2.1 Archetypes as Pre‑Rational Structures  
### 2.2 Gods as Externalized Meaning Systems  
### 2.3 Rituals as Stabilizers of Symbolic Order  
### 2.4 Mythic Authority and the Human Need for Anchors  
### 2.5 Persistence of Myth in Secular Contexts

---

## 3. Layer 2: Psychology (Internal Layer)  
### 3.1 Internalization of Archetypes  
### 3.2 Ego, Shadow, and Projection  
### 3.3 Authority as a Psychological Function  
### 3.4 The Dynamics of Externalization  
### 3.5 Vulnerabilities to Archetypal Inflation

---

## 4. Layer 3: Technology (Externalized Cognitive Layer)  
### 4.1 Tools as Carriers of Human Intent  
### 4.2 AI as a New Site of Projection  
### 4.3 Technological Systems as Meaning‑Makers  
### 4.4 The Illusion of Neutrality  
### 4.5 Infrastructure as Authority

## 5. Interactions Between Layers  
### 5.1 How Mythic Patterns Reappear in Technology  
### 5.2 Psychological Projection Into Technical Systems  
### 5.3 Technological Amplification of Archetypes  
### 5.4 Feedback Loops Across Layers  
### 5.5 When Layers Collapse Into Each Other

---

## 6. Failure Modes of Layer Interaction  
### 6.1 Mythic Inflation in Technological Form  
### 6.2 Collapse of Internal Judgment  
### 6.3 Re‑Centralization of Meaning  
### 6.4 Technological Priesthoods  
### 6.5 Totalization Across Layers

---

## 7. Post‑Imperial Reinterpretation of the Layers  
### 7.1 Maintaining Boundaries Between Layers  
### 7.2 Designing for Plurality  
### 7.3 Preventing Layer Collapse  
### 7.4 Supporting Distributed Meaning Systems  
### 7.5 Reframing Technology as a Participant, Not a Center

## 8. Diagram (Text‑Based)  
### 8.1 Vertical Layer Model 
[Religion Layer]     → Mythic structures, archetypes, gods
↓
[Psychology Layer]   → Internalization, projection, symbolic processing
↓
[Technology Layer]   → Externalized cognition, AI, infrastructure
### 8.2 Circular Interaction Model 
Myth → Psyche → Technology → Myth (feedback loop)
### 8.3 Collapse Scenario  
Religion + Psychology + Technology → Single Authority (Imperial Meaning)
