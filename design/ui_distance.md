# Interface Design for Interpretive Distance  
**Maintaining Symbolic Safety and Preventing Authority Illusion**

This document outlines UI/UX design principles that preserve  
interpretive distance between AI output and human judgment,  
preventing the collapse of symbolic boundaries and the rise  
of technological authority.
